### Using Pytest to practice TDD 

This tdd practice is aimed to get myself comfortable with python testing.

To run the tests, first clone the repo, then in the command line run ```pip install pytest```.

Once pytest is installed, run the tests with 
```pytest test_math_func.py``` 
OR 
```py.test```
